# AOC (Advent of Code)

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 
All have been written using Python 3 (so far). 

Currently, 2022 is the only year I have participated whilst the event is ongoing. Earlier years have been attempted retroactively. 
If a day is missing, it's usually either because I intend to rewrite it, or I haven't attempted it, yet.
